Dreams are fascinating and still not fully understood. Every night, as we drift into sleep, our minds embark on vivid journeysâ€”sometimes bizarre, sometimes meaningful. Some scientists believe dreaming is a way for our brains to process emotions and consolidate memories, helping us make sense of our daily experiences. Others think dreams help us solve problems or rehearse for real-life situations, acting as a kind of mental playground.

Throughout history, dreams have inspired art, inventions, and even scientific breakthroughs. From ancient civilizations interpreting dreams as messages from the gods to modern researchers using brain scans to decode dream patterns, the mystery of why we dream continues to intrigue us. While the exact purpose remains a mystery, dreaming is a universal human experience that connects us all and fuels our imagination.
